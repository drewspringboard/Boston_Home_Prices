# Boston_Home_Prices

## General Info
The purpose of the project is to predict the prices of homes in Boston neighborhoods using linear regression and random forest algorithms. The dataset for the project was collected from 1978 and prices have been adjusted for inflation. Only particular features of interest are used for predictions, and outliers have been eliminated. Namely, the features of interest are number of rooms ('RM'), percentage of low income workers ('LSTAT'), student-teacher ratio ('PTRATIO'), and price of home ('MEDV').
